## Installation

### Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure that you have the following installed on your local machine:

- **Node.js**: [Download and install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- **npm**: Node.js comes with npm (Node Package Manager), but you can install or update it with the following command:
  ```bash
  npm install -g npm
Clone the repository
Clone the repository to your local machine:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/chat-app.git
cd chat-app
Install dependencies
For the backend and frontend to run, install the necessary dependencies:

Backend (Node.js):

cd backend
npm install
Frontend (React):

cd frontend
npm install


# Usage
Start the server (Backend)
From the backend directory, run the following command to start the server:


npm start
The server will now be running on http://localhost:5000.

Start the React app (Frontend)
Open a new terminal window and navigate to the frontend directory. Then run:

npm start
This will start the React development server on http://localhost:3000.

You should now be able to visit http://localhost:3000 in your browser and use the chat application.

# Technologies Used 

Node.js - Backend server environment for building the API and handling WebSocket connections.
Express - Minimal web framework for Node.js to create the backend server.
Socket.io - Real-time, bidirectional communication between clients and the server for chat functionality.
React - Frontend JavaScript library for building the user interface.
ReactDOM - Renders React components in the browser.
npm - Package manager for managing dependencies and running scripts.
.jsx - JavaScript XML (React components are written in .jsx files).
.css - Used for styling the frontend of the app.
